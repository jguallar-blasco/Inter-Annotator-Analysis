Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone . The next month , once his mother had safely left Syria , Barakat went public .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

" They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He added : ' Many years later , when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency , he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him . ' Among other things , Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate , which showed him making sex with some underage boys .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website . Later , when probed about his personal life , he said he understood the interest but did n't want to broadcast the details , joking that he otherwise risked moving foreign exchange rates and oil prices . The call - in program comes ahead of elections for the Russian parliament Duma slated for September 18 .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Farook and Malik were discovered to have posted an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook just before the attack began . But what about the assault rifles — they were still a mystery .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone .

Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

" They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

In many Islamic states , you either obey Islamic law ( no matter your religion ) or you will suffer . The idea is that the state must be worshiped , and no argument will be tolerated .

Text: A question said to be sent by a 12-year - old girl quickly drew on two of the country 's geopolitical conflicts , asking who Putin would save first if both Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were drowning . While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website . Later , when probed about his personal life , he said he understood the interest but did n't want to broadcast the details , joking that he otherwise risked moving foreign exchange rates and oil prices . The call - in program comes ahead of elections for the Russian parliament Duma slated for September 18 .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power .

Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone . The next month , once his mother had safely left Syria , Barakat went public .

He added : ' Many years later , when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency , he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

" They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: ( Reuters ) Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was officially removed from office . She was technically impeached for violating budget laws , but most believe her ouster has more to do with her unpopularity and the fact that the economy in Latin America 's largest country is in deep trouble . ( Marina Lopes and Dom Phillips ) North Korea 's Kim Jong - un executed his deputy premier of education and sent other top aides to re - education camps . Jong - un apparently blamed the education premier for a “ disrespectful posture ” toward him at a June meeting .

On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev .

America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: A question said to be sent by a 12-year - old girl quickly drew on two of the country 's geopolitical conflicts , asking who Putin would save first if both Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were drowning . While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website . Later , when probed about his personal life , he said he understood the interest but did n't want to broadcast the details , joking that he otherwise risked moving foreign exchange rates and oil prices . The call - in program comes ahead of elections for the Russian parliament Duma slated for September 18 .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Farook and Malik were discovered to have posted an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook just before the attack began . But what about the assault rifles — they were still a mystery .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone . The next month , once his mother had safely left Syria , Barakat went public .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: A question said to be sent by a 12-year - old girl quickly drew on two of the country 's geopolitical conflicts , asking who Putin would save first if both Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were drowning . While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website . Later , when probed about his personal life , he said he understood the interest but did n't want to broadcast the details , joking that he otherwise risked moving foreign exchange rates and oil prices .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone . The next month , once his mother had safely left Syria , Barakat went public .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

" Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked the candidates about the ongoing siege of Aleppo in Syrian . The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: We see this played out every day . In soviet Russia , you either worshiped the state through party participation , or you were executed . In Rome , you either burned incense to Caesar , or you were executed . In China , you either show obeisance to the government , or you will be punished . In many Islamic states , you either obey Islamic law ( no matter your religion ) or you will suffer . The idea is that the state must be worshiped , and no argument will be tolerated .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: ( Reuters ) Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was officially removed from office . She was technically impeached for violating budget laws , but most believe her ouster has more to do with her unpopularity and the fact that the economy in Latin America 's largest country is in deep trouble .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years .

Text: Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked the candidates about the ongoing siege of Aleppo in Syrian . The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , had purchased the handguns legally between three and eight years previously at Annie 's Get Your Gun , an FFL in Corona , California . Farook and Malik were discovered to have posted an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook just before the attack began . But what about the assault rifles — they were still a mystery .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: The dispute over alleged conflicts of interest at the foundation ultimately degenerated into a highly personal dust - up between Chelsea Clinton and Band . Chelsea Clinton insisted that her goals in initiating the outside review were to “ professionalize the Foundation , build it for the future and build it in such a way that supported his [ Bill Clinton ’s ] work and mom ’s . ” However , she also complained that Band had agitated her father by pressing to preserve Teneo ’s ties , including in a phone call on the day Hillary Clinton ’s mother , Dorothy Rodham , passed away . “ I can not believe Doug did this on the day my grandmother died , ” Chelsea Clinton complained to several top Clinton advisers . Soon thereafter , Band complained to Podesta that Chelsea Clinton ’s demands for changes at the foundation were causing undue stress to various foundation officials , including Clinton Foundation CEO Bruce Lindsey , who suffered a stroke around that time . “ She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life , ” Band wrote .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

" They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He added : ' Many years later , when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency , he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him . ' Among other things , Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate , which showed him making sex with some underage boys .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

Text: Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked the candidates about the ongoing siege of Aleppo in Syrian . The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: In 2002 , Sheremet won a journalism prize from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe ( OSCE ) for his reporting on human rights violations in Belarus , including the disappearances of opposition politicians and journalists . The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate . ( Reporting by Natalia Zinets , Sergei Karazy , Alessandra Prentice and Margaryta Chornokondratenko in Kiev , Jack Stubbs and Maria Tsvetkova in Moscow , Andrei Makhovsky in Minsk , and Mohammad Zargham in Washington ; Writing by Matthias Williams ; Editing by John Stonestreet and Diane Craft )

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: “ Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money , and Donald is all about money . ” From a $ 400 million tax giveaway on his first big project , to getting a casino license , to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks , Trump ’s life has been dedicated to the next big score . Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked the candidates about the ongoing siege of Aleppo in Syrian . The regime of President Bashar al - Assad , along with its Russian allies , are bombing the rebel stronghold where an estimated 400,000 people -- 100,000 of them children -- are trapped . " They 're being slaughtered because of bad decisions , " Trump said . When Wallace asked Trump about Russian responsibility for large - scale deaths in bombings there , the Republican candidate did n't respond , saying instead that " Aleppo is a disaster , " and adding that " a lot of this has happened because of Hillary Clinton . " Later , discussing Syria , Trump predicted greater upheaval in future and turned to Clinton , saying " wait ' til you see what happens in the coming years , " and blaming her . " Thanks a lot , Hillary , " he said .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Remember : Nobody knew who these maniacs were or why they were doing this . After a shoot - out , the cops recovered a Smith & Wesson handgun , a Llama handgun , a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle , and a DPMS Panther Arms assault rifle . At the National Tracing Center , they figured out where the guns came from , as well as who bought them — the slain assailants . Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , had purchased the handguns legally between three and eight years previously at Annie 's Get Your Gun , an FFL in Corona , California . Farook and Malik were discovered to have posted an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook just before the attack began . But what about the assault rifles — they were still a mystery .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: A question said to be sent by a 12-year - old girl quickly drew on two of the country 's geopolitical conflicts , asking who Putin would save first if both Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were drowning . While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website . Later , when probed about his personal life , he said he understood the interest but did n't want to broadcast the details , joking that he otherwise risked moving foreign exchange rates and oil prices . The call - in program comes ahead of elections for the Russian parliament Duma slated for September 18 .

Text: That includes the kingdom 's interests in Syria , where Saudi - backed rebel groups are currently battling Iran - backed Shiite militias and Hezbollah forces loyal to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . Saudi Arabia is locked in two other proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Bahrain . Saudi Arabia 's relations with Iran hit a new low in January after the Saudis executed a prominent Shiite cleric , Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , leading Iranian protesters to ransack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran . The kingdom cut off all diplomatic ties with Iran shortly thereafter . Washington 's response to the spat between Saudi Arabia — a longtime US ally — and Iran , with which the Obama administration recently secured a historic nuclear deal , was not as supportive of the Saudis as the kingdom would have hoped . Indeed , as the Saudis continue to balk at the US 's decision to lift nuclear - related sanctions on Iran , Washington has shown few , if any , signs that it intends to prevent Syria from becoming a Russian - Iranian sphere of influence .

What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: It is worth remembering that many wealthy allies spend a lot more of their national wealth on development aid and refugee resettlement than does the United States — on average , in the range of 0.5 percent of GDP more than we do , which is real money even measured against the sizes of our military budgets . NATO allies also commit much more to United Nations peacekeeping missions than we do — roughly 10,000 troops , plus or minus , in recent decades . While they did not match us in Afghanistan , they collectively suffered more than 1,000 fatalities and have stuck with the mission for 15 long , hard years . Those who question the basic value of our alliances or engagement overseas go too far . Nor is it all about military power . European members of NATO are absorbing the greatest costs and risks in applying sanctions on Russia over its behavior in Ukraine .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

The OSCE called on Wednesday for action to address the safety of journalists in Ukraine . The founder of Ukrayinska Pravda , Georgiy Gongadze , was an investigative journalist who was murdered 16 years ago , his decapitated body discovered in a forest outside Kiev . The incident helped to precipitate the Orange Revolution of 2004/05 , which resulted in an election re - run and the victory of an opposition presidential candidate .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

He added : ' Many years later , when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency , he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him . ' Among other things , Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate , which showed him making sex with some underage boys .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Barakat decided to escape the country , but not before securing the minutes of the meetings , which were stored in the members’ offices . He also planned to steal correspondence between the Crisis Cell and the Presidential office , the Prime Minister , and the minister of the interior . On a day off , Barakat ransacked the offices , taking as many documents as he could , before driving some two hundred and fifty miles north from Damascus , to the Turkish border . Syrian troops controlled the crossing point . But , with more than a thousand pages taped to his body , Barakat managed to slip through and check into a hotel under a false name before anyone in Damascus realized that he was gone . The next month , once his mother had safely left Syria , Barakat went public .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan .

Through Cohn , Trump made choices that — gratuitously , it appears — resulted in his first known business dealings with mob - controlled companies and unions , a pattern that continued long after Cohn died . What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long , close and wide - ranging dealings with organized crime figures , with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers , his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump ’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum , are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots .

Text: Last year , Islamic State troops moved into the ancient city of Palmyra and began waging war on what the terrorist group labeled as " false idolatry . " More likely , ISIS aimed to erase a large part of Syria 's rich cultural history , which was remembered by monuments of Christian , Sufi , and Shiite origin . The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy . Now , more than one year after the occupation of Palmyra began , the group has released previously unseen video footage of ISIS fighters looting and smashing artifacts , and even crushing Syrian mummies under the wheels of bulldozers . Soldiers are shown entering one of the city 's museums and smashing limestone busts resembling classic Syrian funerary reliefs . An unidentified structure is blown up by an explosive .

Text: We see this played out every day . In soviet Russia , you either worshiped the state through party participation , or you were executed . In Rome , you either burned incense to Caesar , or you were executed . In China , you either show obeisance to the government , or you will be punished . In many Islamic states , you either obey Islamic law ( no matter your religion ) or you will suffer . The idea is that the state must be worshiped , and no argument will be tolerated .

While calling it a difficult question , he appeared to condemn both leaders , saying " if someone is determined to drown you ca n't help them . " " I would say , you can not save someone who has decided to drown . But of course we are ready to lend a helping hand and friendship to any of our partners , if they want to take it , " he said , according to a transcript on the Kremlin 's website .

Text: Against this backdrop , for the period of 2007 - 2012 , the United States has averaged 4.9 homicides per 100,000 persons . America thus stands more or less shoulder to shoulder with Iran ( 4.1 ) , Cuba ( 4.2 ) , Latvia ( 4.7 ) , and Albania ( 5 ) . So much for the data on homicides tout court . The question then is whether or not to consider America ’s standing among countries like these to be an aberration . Such states certainly are n’t in the same class as the United States in terms of development metrics like per capita GDP , and this fact tends to get cited by American politicians and political observers as prima facie evidence that something else ( whether “ terrorists ” or guns ) is skewing their country ’s violence data , pushing it out of its allegedly more “ natural ” peer group — places like the Scandinavian states , the U.K. , or Japan . But while such comparisons may sound rigorous at first blush , they are often naively aspirational ( at best ) or deliberately deceptive and chauvinistic ( at worst ) .

Text: And if the incumbent foreign government complains about the “ benevolent US assistance”then it can be toppled because it is “ siding with the terrorists ” . This is , of course , the whole rationale behind the so - called War on Terror that Washington crafted in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . Just uttering the phrase War on Terror gives Washington license to invade and ransack any foreign state it chooses , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , where more than one million people were killed by US forces “ hunting down terrorists ” . Before that , the official pretexts were “ War on Communism”or “ War on Drugs ” . But with the collapse of the “ Evil Soviet Empire ” , the first of these pretexts became redundant . Although , Washington and its NATO allies are trying their best to revive the “ Russian Scare”by demonizing Vladimir Putin as the “ new Hitler in Europe ” .

The desert oasis was once known as a melting pot of faiths and ethnicities , and by demolishing its artifacts , the jihadists also hoped to eradicate knowledge of its diverse legacy .
